            This project entailed analyzing the statistics of pokemons. 
            <br/><br/>
            To read our findings and the report, I have attached the report as a pdf below: <br/>
            <a href = "pdf/pokemon_report.pdf">Pokemon - The Myths and the Legends: Can you Catch 'Em All?</a>
            <br/>
            You can find all the important graphs and figures, as well as our description of our findings within the report.
            <br/><br/>
            We also presented a presentation, detailing our findings.
