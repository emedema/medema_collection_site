                Erzsébet (Elizabeth) Bathory (1560-1614) - the Countess of Blood (or Countess Dracula) was a Hungarian Countess, whom according to court records killed, tortured, and mutilated 80 young girls (the number of victims is purported to be upwards of 650). Due to the graphic nature of her crimes, Countess Dracula has become a figure of inhumane bloodlust and narcissism in popular media such as Lore. Indeed, Lore weaves the tale of the monstrous Countess and innocent victims, perfectly depicting the horrendous results of deviance from patriarchal gender norms. For example, female killers tend to contradict most societal gender roles, especially when there is a certain penchant toward sadism, such as in the case of the Countess. Women are generally considered to be delicate, emotional, compassionate, illogical, and nurturing; however, Elizabeth, while emotional over her husband’s death and clearly mentally ill, is a cold sophisticated killer who was logical enough to evade detection for decades. In fact, Elizabeth even contradicts societal perceptions of female killers by torturing and mutilating her victims instead of killing through the use of poison. Elizabeth clearly contradicts patriarchal perceptions of women being nurturing and compassionate as she delves into her wicked proclivities, executing her depraved desires and relishes forcing others to perform the hellish events. Depicting Elizabeth Bathory, a woman who deviates from societal norms, as sadistic and psychopathic serves to warn women from contradicting conventions as doing so would cause one to become monstrous. However, Lore features an interesting juxtaposition between the macabre Countess and the innocent Lady Margit. Lady Margit, an aspiring healer, is kind, compassionate, naive and sexually inexperienced, altogether the epitome of a woman according to society. Sadly, despite Margit’s compliance with gender roles, she was killed in a horrific manner by Elizabeth, which clearly suggests that acceptance of societal conventions will result in death. In contrast, Ava (one of the Countess’ handmaidens) is a mixture of deviancy and compliance, fitting the female stereotypes of being frightened and passive, while also being protective (a male tendency). Ava, a character that meets stereotypes of both genders, also met a brutal demise. If being non-conforming makes one inhuman and being conforming results in death, then how are women supposed to live as humans within the Patriarchy?

                <b>Meta-Commentary: </b>
                There is a lot I could have done with Lore and the story of Elizabeth Bathory. For instance, due to time passing the records of the trial and motivation of Bathory’s crimes are questionable as overtime rumours and myths have been perpetuated into absolute truth. Nonetheless, it has been suggested that the Countess is simply a victim of the patriarchy, that her alleged crimes were a ploy for removing an independent woman from a position of power. Historically, this makes sense as at the time the King of Hungary was jealous of a woman in power and in debt to the Bathory’s, thus he seized the opportunity of a noble's death in order to remove Elizabeth from power. Rumours of witchcraft and multiple lovers (perhaps even female ones) surrounded the Countess. Perhaps the openness of her relations and her independent power threatened Patriarchal beliefs? There is also a lot of opportunity for a Marxist approach as class plays a large part in the investigation and trial of Elizabeth Bathory. Similarly, psychoanalysis would also be interesting as Elizabeth clearly displays issues with mental health, especially with the fixation of blood.
