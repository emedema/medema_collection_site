        <h4>
            This site is a collection of the works of Emily Medema, me! All of this work has been produced throughout my
            degree at the University of British Columbia. During my time at university I have undergone various English courses,
            Data courses, and Computer Science courses. In those courses I have written a lot of reports, of those I am quite proud
            of a few. You can find those here. I have also put completed side projects, incomplete projects, and ideas I have for projects.

        <a href = "frankenstein.html"/>“Lost in time, and lost in space... and meaning”: Deviancy as a Structure for Meaning in Frankenstein and Adaptations</a>
        <p>
            Above is an essay regarding Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, written for my ENGL 250: Introduction to Literary Theory class. 
            I really enjoyed researching for and writing this essay. Learning about deviancy and its presence in Frankenstein and Frankenstein Adaptations, such as Rocky Horror Picture Show
            was a lot of fun.

        <a href = "bathory.html"/>Dead or Monstrous: A Feminist Analysis of Gender Roles in Lore’s “Elizabeth Bathory: Mirror Mirror”</a>
        <p>
            This short analysis was also for ENGL 250. For these assignments we were supposed to analyze a piece of media of our choice. In this analysis
            I decided to perform a feminist analysis on the episode of <em>Lore</em> about Elizabeth Bathory.

         <h4>Ideas for Projects and Writing</h4>
        <em>Writing Noir</em>
        <p>
            Its 1920 Toronto and Kingpin is reiging supreme. 
            That is something Dt. Hell Day cannot abide. 
            Hell is determined to find a weak spot in the Carchidi organization, she needs to bring them down. 
            No one can threaten her Ma, beat up her brother. 
            There will be hell to pay. 
            Though Old flames are liable to do anything in this city, Mara is Hell's best shot at getting the right information. 
            Sometimes you gotta play with fire and hope to god you don’t get burned
